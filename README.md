# OscilloGraph

version - 0.2.1.5

Draws pictures on an oscilloscope

Firstly going to use only Y input oscilloscope and syncronize the oscilloskope generator, then going to use X and Y oscilloscope.

I use Arduino Mega 2560 PWM to send signals and voltage divider to have different Y positions. 

PC's software is written on Java and sends the resized and recolored picture to Arduino.

They communicate via COM port
